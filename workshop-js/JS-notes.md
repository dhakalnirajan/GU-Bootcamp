Objects:

JavaScript objects are the containers for named variables called properties. Objects are:

- created using the Object constructor.

- indexed by keys, which can be either strings or numbers.

- mutable, meaning their properties can be changed.

- passed by reference, meaning that if you assign a variable to an object, this variable  will always refer to that object.

- dynamic, meaning that you can add new properties to them at any time.

- unordered, meaning that the order of the properties is not guaranteed.

- case sensitive, meaning that properties can be referred to in a case  sensitive manner.
